    "# Introduction & Fermionic Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In digital quantum computing, the fundamental unit of information is typically an addressable two-level quantum system called a qubit. Within the circuit model, each qubit is assigned a wire in the circuit. After _initialization_ in a well-defined state (e.g. the ground state 0), gates applied to these wires describe an _evolution_ of the state under a sequence of unitary operations. A _measurement_ on a wire then projects the corresponding unit of information onto one of its internal states (0 or 1 for qubits).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum simulation architectures based on cold atoms have been vastly explored for the simulation of condensed matter systems in the last two decades. [1] Their experimental control has advanced to a point where they now offer varying degrees of programmability making them strong candidates for a novel kind of quantum information processor.\n",
    "Similar to the qubit circuits described above, experiments run on cold atomic quantum simulators are also commonly described by an _initialization_ in some easy-to-prepare state, a subsequent _evolution_ of the state under programmable unitary operations and finally a _measurement_ yielding information about the quantum state of the atoms such as location, momentum or spin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to these similarities between the qubits and cold atomic quantum systems we can abstract quantum computations and simulations run on cold atomic systems in quantum circuits where the wires represent the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms which are accessed by the measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit's cold atom module explores such circuit-based descriptions of cold atomic experiments, leveraging the existing Qiskit control stack and building upon functionality such as circuits, backends, gates, providers etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this module enables two different settings:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A \"fermionic\" setting where the individual units of information are the occupations of fermionic modes realized by trapped fermionic atoms as described in this tutorial. \n",
    "2. A \\\"spin\\\" setting where the individual units of information are orientations of long spins as realized by trapped Bose-Einstein-Condensates. This is introduced in the [spin circuits tutorial](./02_spin_circuits.ipynb)."

    "## Fermionic setting\n",
    "\n",
    "In a fermionic setting, the wires of a quantum circuit describe the occupations of individual fermionic modes. Due to the Pauli exclusion principle, a fermionic mode can either be empty, i.e. in the \"vacuum state\" $\\left| 0 \\right>$ or occupied $\\left| 1 \\right>$. However, no two particles can occupy the same mode. We assign one wire to each fermionic mode in the quantum circuit describing such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying gates to this fermionic register, we need to initialize some modes with particles, which is done with a `load` instruction. Importing the `qiskit_cold_atom.fermions` module will add this instruction to the `QuantumCircuit` class."
